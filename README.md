### FAQ
* **What can I do to help?**

  Use the site and bot, find bugs, report bugs. We really appreciate how the community has embraced MSF.gg, and really want your feedback. Also if you have a great idea for the site, please add it to the [issues](https://github.com/tyejae/msf.gg.public/issues) page.
* **Can you add farming location info on each character page?**

  No. Unfortunately, the data for farming locations isn't exposed to us yet. Farming locations are available via the bot but as it's manually updated so they aren't always up to date.
* **Can I join the team?**

  Right now, the two of us are working hard to make the site the best it can be. In the future we may add more help as needed, but we aren't actively looking right now.
* **Do you have a Discord channel?**

  I'm glad you asked! Here is the link to join the server: https://discord.gg/msfgg.
